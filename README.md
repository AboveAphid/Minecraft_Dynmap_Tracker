# What tf does this do?
Well the Dynmap tracker basically uses the website of a minecraft
server and while the "databaseUpdator" script is running
it will save all the user's health, armor, XYZ coords, etc
into 2 SQL databases.
This was mainly just a "quick" fun little project for data anaylses / data gathering on minecraft servers using Dynmap.
1. Main
    > Contains there Username
    > UUID
    > Account Creation Date (Not implemented yet)
    > Head Icon (Url)
    > Skin (Url)
    > ValidUser (Basically if the user's UUID was able to be found. This is for if it is a Bedrock & Java server)

2. Users
    > id (Just counts up)
    > timestamp - Time this data chunk was collected
    > x
    > y
    > z
    > map_chunk_x - Not like Minecraft's chunks but the chunk x on the website's map instead
    > map_chunk_z - Same as above (but for Z/Y)
    > health
    > armor
    > region - 
    > world - Vanilla (Overworld), Vanilla_Nether (Nether), Vanilla_the_End (The End) 
    > servertime
    > minecraft_time - Minecraft Time (converted from servertime)

Using the "viewer" script it allows you to quickly look through
the Databases in a simple terminal UI (Warning may break depending on operating system).

# How to use
1. Make sure config has correct values
2. Then run databaseUpdator atleast once. (You can run this script in the background)
2. Then to look at this data run the "viewer" python script
3. You should get these options:
[0] Track                                   - Get player's current/latest info. E.g. POS, Last Seen Time, 

[1] Check Database Status                   - Check if database Main.db and Users.db is connected to script

[2] Refresh/Reconnect Databases             - Reconnect to Main.db and Users.db

[3] Check Database Updater Status           - Check if databaseUpdater script is running

[4] See All Processes                       - Lists out all currently running processes on computer (kinda like TaskManager)

[5] Check Minecraft Server Status           - Check if minecraft server is online

[6] Check Website Map Status                - Check if dynmap website provided is online

[7] Player Map                              - Generate a image based on every chunk the player has been seen in
